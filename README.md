# Cognito Forms UX/UI Exercise II

Please write the HTML and CSS for a UI component with the following charactaristics. Please be prepared to revise your work based on feedback.

- A container with exactly four buttons
- The first two buttons must be on the left of the container, the last two buttons must be on the right of the container
- The first two buttons can be between 1 and 40 characters. The last two buttons will always be "Cancel" and "Save"
- The buttons and button text must always stay on one line
- On constrained viewports the variable-width buttons can be truncated when necessary. The last two buttons must never be truncated.
- The component should look like the examples below.

**Extra Credit:** Display a tooltip (doesn't matter how it looks) upon hovering over a button that has truncated text. The tooltip should not appear if the text is not truncated.

### Example with plenty of room
